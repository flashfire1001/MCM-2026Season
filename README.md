# MCM-2026Season
A repo for documenting the learning logs and resources for mathematical modeling, data analysis, and technical essay writing—intended for MCM/ICM (2026 season).

## 📂 Structure  

- **`/modeling`**: Notes on mathematical models (e.g., optimization, simulation), case studies, and failed/successful attempts.  
- **`/data-analysis`**: Python/R scripts for cleaning/visualizing data, datasets used, and statistical methods.  
- **`/essay-writing`**: Templates for problem statements, argument structures, LaTeX examples, and writing tips.  
- **`/logs`**: Chronological entries (Markdown) reflecting on challenges, lessons learned, and resources.  

## 🛠️ Key Features  

- **Problem-Solving**: Breakdowns of classic MCM/ICM problems (e.g., 2023 "Eco-System") with my approach.  
- **Code Snippets**: Python (Pandas, NumPy) or R for data tasks, with comments explaining logic.  
- **Writing Guides**: LaTeX templates for papers, how to structure abstracts/introductions, and avoiding common pitfalls.  

## 📌 Usage  

1. Browse `/logs` for dated reflections or `/modeling` for specific techniques.  
2. Use `/data-analysis` scripts as starters for your own projects (modify as needed).  
3. Check `/essay-writing` for LaTeX boilerplates or persuasive writing examples.  

## 🎯 Goals  

- Track progress in modeling/writing skills over time.  
- Share reusable tools (code/templates/notes) for future contestants.  
- Reflect on mistakes to avoid repeating them.
