The topic:

How does types of plant species influence their reaction to environmental hazard like droughts?

Main factors:

- Types of plants:
    1. minimal number of species necessary for communicate to benefit from it
- frequency and the intensity of the drought

Other factors:
- pollution and habitat reduction

you should develop a math model for predicting:
1. plant community changes(density/biodiversity/population)
2. over time : long term
3. long-term interactions of a community of plants and the larger environment.

you should have the N(number of species) + f(frequency) + I(intensity) at least
you should give a explanation of what your model indicates and what method should be take based on such finding.

The paper should include:

 One-page Summary Sheet.
 Table of Contents.
 Your complete solution.
 Reference List
No more than 25 pages

Book marks is favor for PDF.
